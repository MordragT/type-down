## CLI

- fmt
- compile (pdf | html)

## Planned Outputs

- docx
- html
- pdf
- reveal

## Planned templates

- curriculum vitae
- calendar/todo (like markdown when ?)
- presentation (reveal ?)

## Pipeline

- cst (generated by Parseable and Syntactical derive Macros)
- ast, context (from cst, context holds variables and builtin funcitons/variables)

TODO: Abstraction over ast before compilation:

- go from description of ast to concrete
- e.g. Emphasis -> Text-Italic

- make conversion overridable by different backends
- e.g. html has many high level elements, while pdf might not,
  - then html can be overriden and pdf can use the default path
