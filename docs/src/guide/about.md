# What is TypeDown ?

TypeDown is a simple markup language wich takes inspiration from [Typst](https://typst.app/)
but focuses on being embeddable into your own projects.
Therefore it is better compared to Markdown.

## Use Cases

- **Notes**
    TypeDown provides a clean, readable syntax for taking notes, documentation, and knowledge management.
    Its simplicity makes it ideal for quick note-taking while still offering rich formatting capabilities that can be rendered beautifully.

- **Automation**
    With its embeddable nature, TypeDown can be integrated into automation workflows.
    It can be used to generate formatted reports, documentation, or templated content programmatically.
    This makes it perfect for scenarios where you need to combine data processing with human-readable output.

- **Content Management**
    TypeDown serves as an excellent format for content that needs to be both human-editable and machine-processable.
    Its straightforward syntax makes it suitable for content authors while remaining easy to parse and transform.

- **Documentation**
    Technical documentation benefits from TypeDown's balance of simplicity and formatting power.
    It's particularly useful in scenarios where documentation needs to be version-controlled alongside code.
