# List

The List element defines a bulleted list. List items are created by an '-' followed by a space and its content.
The first item **must** begin on a new line.
List items can be further indented to create nested sub-lists.

::: info
Labels can be attached to each list item.

## Example

```
- This is the first list item {label}
- This is the second list item
    - This is a nested list item under the second item
```
